# IMPORTANT: optimal solution is obtained using CVX to measure 
# the accuracy of the solution found 
#
# In this example, APDB algorithm is specified to solve Quadratic Constrained 
# Quadratic Programming (QCQP) 
#
# See section 5.1. of the corresponding paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01401.pdf

# APD_c corresponds to constant stepsizes (Theorem 2.1 part (I)). Resulting in a
# convergence rate of O(1/k).
# When the problem is strongly convex (mu>0) APD_sc uses non-constant stepsizes 
# (Theorem 2.1 part (II)). Resulting in a convergence rate of O(1/k^2).
